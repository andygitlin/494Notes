\noindent \textbf{Rings}
\begin{defn} \hspace{0.5cm}
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item A \textbf{ring} is a tuple $(R, +, \cdot, 0)$ where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $R$ is a set
        \item $0 \in R$
        \item $+,\cdot: R \times R \rightarrow R$, $\quad$  $(a,b) \mapsto a + b, a \cdot b$
    \end{itemize}
    subject to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(R, +, 0)$ is an abelian group
        \item $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
        \item $(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$
        \item $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
    \end{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{ring with unity} is a tuple $(R, +, \cdot, 0, 1)$, where
    $(R,+,\cdot,0)$ is a ring, and $1 \in R$ is subject to $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$
    for all $a \in R$.
    \item A ring $(R, +, \cdot, 0)$ is called \textbf{commutative} if $ab = ba$ for all
    $a, b \in R$.
    \item A \textbf{field} is a commutative ring with unity $(R,+,\cdot,0,1)$ such
    that $(R \backslash \{0\}, \cdot, 1)$ is a group.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk} \hspace{0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We don't really need to include 0,1 in notation: they are unique
        if they exist
        \item There is a notion of a \textbf{skew field}: ring with unity
        $(R,+,\cdot,0,1)$ such that $(R \backslash \{0\}, \cdot , 1)$ is a group.
        (This drops the commutative condition from the definition of a field).
        \item In French: \textit{corps} is a skew field, and \textit{corps commutatif} is a field.
    \end{itemize}
\end{rmk}
\begin{fact}\label{fact:0prod}
 Let $R$ be a ring. For all $a \in R$, $0 \cdot a = 0$.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
    $(0 \cdot a) = (0 + 0) \cdot a = 0 \cdot a + 0 \cdot a \Rightarrow 0 = 0 \cdot a$
\end{proof}
\begin{ex} \hspace{0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\ZZ$ is a ring, commutative, with unity
        \item $\QQ, \RR, \CC$ are fields
        \item $\HH = \{a + bi + cj + dk \mid a,b,c,d \in \RR \}$ where $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$ are
        called the \textbf{Hamiltonian Quaternions} and are a skew-field
        \item $\mathcal{C}_{C}(\RR) = $ functions on $\RR$ with compact
        support \\
        ($\supp(f) = \overline{\{x \in \RR \mid f(x) \neq 0\}}$) is a
        commutative ring without unity
        \item $R = \{\star\}, 0 = 1 = \star$ is the \textbf{zero ring}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}
\begin{fact}
    If $(R,+,\cdot,0,1)$ is a ring with unity and $0 = 1$, then $R$ is the zero ring.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
    Take $a \in R$. Then $a = a \cdot 1 = a \cdot 0 = 0$ by Fact \ref{fact:0prod}.
\end{proof}
\noindent \underline{Convention}: Unless otherwise noted, ring will refer to
a commutative ring with 1.
\begin{defn}
    Let $R$ be a ring. Its \textbf{group of units} is
    $$
    R^\times = \{a \in R \mid \exists \, b \in R: ab = 1\}
    $$
\end{defn}
\begin{fact} \hspace{0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $a \in R^\times$, there is a unique $b \in R$ such that $ab = 1$.
        Write $b = a^{-1}$.
        \item For $a,b \in R^\times$, $a \cdot b \in R^\times$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{fact}
\begin{proof} \hspace{0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Given $b, b^\prime$, we have $b = b \cdot 1 = b(ab^\prime) = (ba)b^\prime = 1 \cdot b^\prime
         = b^\prime$.
         \item $(a \cdot b) \cdot (b^{-1} \cdot a^{-1}) = 1$
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\begin{ex}
    $\RR^\times = \RR \backslash \{0\}$, $\ZZ^\times = \{1, -1\}$
\end{ex}
\begin{defn}
    Let $R, S$ be rings. A \textbf{morphism} $\phi:R \rightarrow S$ is a map of
    sets $\varphi:R \rightarrow S$ satisfying
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\varphi(a + b) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b)$
        \item $\varphi(a \cdot b) = \varphi(a) \cdot \varphi(b)$
        \item $\varphi(1) = 1$
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    $\varphi:\ZZ \rightarrow \ZZ$ $u \mapsto 0$ is \underline{not} a morphism of
    rings with 1. (it is a morphism of general rings).
\end{ex}
\begin{fact}\label{fact:!morph}
    For any ring $R$ there is a unique morphism $\varphi:\ZZ \rightarrow R$. Given
    $z \in \ZZ$, we write $z_{R}$, or simply $z$ for its image under $\varphi$.
\end{fact}
\begin{ex}
    $5 \in \ZZ$, $5_{\QQ} \in \QQ$ usual number $5$. $5_{\Zn 2} = 1_{\Zn 2}$
\end{ex}
\begin{defn}
    Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $I \subset R$ is called an \textbf{ideal} if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $I$ is a subgroup of $(R, +, 0)$
        \item $a \cdot f \in I$ for all $a \in R, f \in I$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $S \subset R$ is called a \textbf{subring} if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $S$ is a subgroup of $(R, +, 0)$
        \item $a \cdot b \in S$ for all $a, b \in S$.
        \item $1 \in S$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{rmk}\hspace{0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The only subset that is both a subring and an ideal is $R$ itself.
        (reason: if $1 \in I$, then $a \cdot 1 \in I$ for all $a \in R$, meaning $I = R$)
        \item $I = \{0\}, I = R$ are always ideals.
        \item In rings without unity, the 2 notions align closer: ideal becomes a special
        case of subring as $1 \in S$ condition is dropped.
    \end{itemize}
\end{rmk}
\begin{ex} \hspace{0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every subgroup of $(\ZZ, +, 0)$ is an ideal of $\ZZ$.
        \item If $F$ is a field, then $\{0\}, R$ are the only ideals
        \item Let $R = \mathcal{C}_C(\RR), S \in R$ subset.
        $$
        I = \{f \in \mathcal{C}_C(\RR) \mid f \mid_{S} = 0 \}
        $$
        is an ideal
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}
\begin{defn}
    An ideal $I \in R$ is called \textbf{principal} if $I = \{a \cdot r \mid r \in R\}$
    for some $a \in R$. Then $a$ is called a \textbf{generator}.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    Let $a_1, a_2, \dots a_n \in R$. An \textbf{ideal generated by} $a_1, \dots a_n$ is
    $$
    (a_1, \dots a_n) = \{a_1r_1 + \dots + a_nr_n \mid r_i \in R\}
    $$
\end{defn}
\begin{fact}
    Given ideals $I, J \subset R$ we have
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $I \cap J$ is an ideal
        \item $I + J = \{a + b \mid a \in I, b \in J \}$ is an ideal
        \item $I \cdot J = \left\{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}a_ib_i \mid a_i \in I, b_i \in J \right\}$ is an ideal
    \end{itemize}
\end{fact}
\section{January 6, 2017} %Pranav
\begin{fact}
    Let $\varphi: R \rightarrow S$ be a morphism. Then
    $$
    \ker(\varphi) = \{x \in R \mid \varphi(x) = 0\}
    $$
    is an ideal.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof} (A Pranav Exclusive)
    We first show that the kernel is a subgroup of $(R, +, 0)$. Well, we first show that
    $0 \in \ker(\varphi)$. Well,
    $$
    \varphi(0) = \varphi(0 + 0) = \varphi(0) + \varphi(0)
    $$
    so, we have that $\varphi(0) = 0$ and thus $0 \in \ker(\phi)$.
    Next, we show that inverses are in the kernel as well. \\
    If we have that $\varphi(a) = 0$, then we have
    $$0 = \varphi(0) = \varphi(a + (-a)) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(-a) = \varphi(-a)$$
    Now, we complete this step by proving closure. Assume $a,b \in \ker(\varphi)$. Then,
    $$\phi(a + b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b) = 0 + 0 = 0$$
    Thus, we have that the kernel is a subgroup. Now, we verify the second condition.
    Fix $a \in R$ and $f \in \ker(\varphi)$. We have that
    $$
    \phi(a \cdot f) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(f) = \phi(a) \cdot 0 = 0
    $$
    Thus, we have that $a \cdot f \in \ker(\varphi)$, meaning that $\ker(\varphi)$
    is an ideal.
\end{proof}
\noindent Question: Is every ideal the kernel of morphism?
\begin{prop}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I \subset R$ an ideal. Let $R / I$ be the quotient of
    abelian groups and $p: R \rightarrow R / I$ the canonical projection. Then there is a
    unique product map
    $$
    \cdot: R/I \times R/I \rightarrow R/I
    $$
    making $R / I$ into a ring such that $p$ is a morphism.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    For $p$ to be a morphism of rings, we need
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p(1_R) = 1_{R/I}$
        \item The following diagram to commute
        \[ \begin{tikzcd}[%
        ,every arrow/.append style={maps to}
        ,every label/.append style={font=\normalsize}
        ,row sep=1.5cm
        ,column sep=1.5cm]
        R \times R \arrow{r}{\cdot_R} \arrow[swap]{d}{p \times p} & R \arrow{d}{p} \\%
        R/I \times R/I \arrow{r}{\cdot_{R/I}}& R/I
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    \end{itemize}
    Uniqueness of $\cdot_{R/I}$ follows from surjectivity of $p \times p$ (each element
    in $R / I \times R/I$ must go precisely to the result of the composition of $p$ and
    $\cdot_R$) \\
    For existence, define $1_{R/I} = p(1_R)$ and $(a + I) \cdot (b + I) \defeq (a \cdot b) + I$.
    We have to show this is well-defined (i.e it is independent of choice of $a, b$). \\
    Well, choose $a^\prime, b^\prime$ such that $a^\prime  + I = a + I, b^\prime + I = b + I$.
    Thus, $a^\prime = a + i$, $b^\prime = b + j$ for some $i, j \in I$. Then
    $$
    (a^\prime + I)(b^\prime + I) = (a^\prime \cdot b^\prime) + I = ((a + i)\cdot(b + j)) + I =
    (a\cdot b + a \cdot j + b \cdot i + i \cdot j) + I = a\cdot b + I
    $$
    as we note that $a \cdot j, b \cdot i$, and $i \cdot j$ are all in $I$ as $I$
    is an ideal. \\
    We have that all of the ring axioms for $R / I$ are inherited from the ring
    structure on $R$.
\end{proof}
\begin{rmk}
    $\ker(p) = I$
\end{rmk}
\begin{thm}\label{thm:homomorphism} \textbf{(Homomorphism Theorem):}
    Let $\phi: R \rightarrow S$ be a morphism of rings, $I \subset \ker(\varphi)$ be
    an ideal of $R$. There is a unique morphism $\overline{\varphi}: R/I \rightarrow S$
    such that $\overline{\varphi} \circ p = \varphi$ i.e.
    \[
\begin{tikzcd}[,every arrow/.append style={maps to}
,every label/.append style={font=\normalsize},column sep=1.5em]
 & R/I \arrow{dr}{\overline{\varphi}} \\
R \arrow{ur}{p} \arrow{rr}{\varphi} && S
\end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes. Moreover, $\overline{\varphi}$ is injective $\iff$ $\ker(\varphi) = I$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    All statements follow from looking at the abelian group $(R, +, 0)$ and its
    subgroup $I$, except multiplicativity of $\overline{\varphi}$. \\
    (A Pranav Exclusive) Some justification:
    the uniqueness of this morphism follows because the projection map is surjective, meaning that in
    order for the composition to be commutative, we must have that each element in $R / I$ maps exactly
    to where its associated element maps under $\varphi$. Now, the existence. We simply need to check that
    the map $\overline{\varphi}$ that sends $a + I$ to $\varphi(a)$ is well defined and is a morphism. We note that
    the additive morphism properties are inherited from the fact that $\varphi$ is a morphism itself. So, we check
    the well-definedness of $\overline{\varphi}$. Pick 2 representatives of $a + I$, call them $a + I$ and
    $a^\prime + I$. We have that $a^\prime = a + i$ for $i \in I$. Then, we have that
    $$
    \overline{\varphi}(a^\prime + I) = \overline{\varphi}(a + i + I) = \overline{\varphi}(a + I) + \overline{\varphi}(i + I) =
    \overline{\varphi}(a + I) + \overline{\varphi}(I) = \overline{\varphi}(a + I) + 0
    $$
    as we have that $\varphi(i) = 0$ for all $i \in I$ (since $I \subset \ker(\varphi)$). We finally verify the injective
    biconditional. Assume $\overline{\varphi}$ is injective. We already have that $I \subset \ker(\varphi)$.
    Now, since $\overline{\varphi}$ is injective, its kernel is trivial, and is thus the identity of $R / I$, namely $I$ itself.
    For any $g \in \ker(\varphi)$ we note that $g + I$ must belong to the kernel of $\overline{\varphi}$, meaning that
    $g + I = I$ and thus $g \in I$. This gives us double containment and thus equality. \\
    Now, assume that $\ker(\varphi) = I$. We consider $\ker(\overline{\varphi})$. This is exactly the collection
    $\{a + I \mid a \in \ker(\varphi) \}$. Thus, this is $\{a + I \mid a \in I\}$ and thus we have that
    $\ker(\overline{\varphi}) = I$. Since the kernel of $\overline{\varphi}$ is trivial, we have that
    $\overline{\varphi}$ is injective. \\
    Checking Multiplicativity: Let $A,B \in R/I$. Choose $a,b \in R$ such that $p(a) = A, p(b) = B$. Then
    $$
    \overline{\varphi}(A \cdot B) = \overline{\varphi}(p(a)\cdot p(b)) =
    \overline{\varphi}(p(ab)) = \varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) =
    \overline{\varphi}(p(a))\overline{\varphi}(p(b)) = \overline{\varphi}(A)\overline{\varphi}(B)
    $$
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
    Let $R$ be a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $a,b \in R$. We say that \textbf{$a$ divides $b$} (denoted $a \mid b$)
        if there is $c \in R$ such that $ac = b$.
        \item We say $0 \neq a \in R$ is a \textbf{zero divisor} if there is
        $0 \neq b \in R$ such that $ab = 0$.
        \item We call $R$ a \textbf{domain} (or \textbf{integral domain}) if it has
        no zero divisors.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{fact}
    $a \mid b \iff (b) \subset (a) \iff b \in (a)$
\end{fact}
\begin{proof} (A Pranav Exclusive)
    We first show the first forward implication. Assume that $a \mid b$. Then, there is
    $c \in R$ such that $ac = b$. Now, fix $g \in (b)$. It is of the form $br$ for some
    $r \in R$. Thus, we have that $g = (ac)r = a(cr)$. Since $cr \in R$, we have that $g \in (a)$. \\
    Next, we show the second forward implication. Assume that $(b) \subset (a)$. Well,
    $b \in (b) \subset (a)$. \\
    Finally, we show that $b \in (a)$ implies the original condition. Well, if $b \in (a)$, then
    $b = ar$ for $r \in R$. This is exactly what it means for $a \mid b$! Thus, we have
    shown equality of the above statements.
\end{proof}
\begin{fact} (Cancellation Law) If $a \neq 0 \in R$ is not a zero divisor, then
    for $x,y \in R$
    $$
    ax = ay \Rightarrow x = y
    $$
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
    $ax = ay \iff a(x - y) = 0$. $a \neq 0$ implies that $x - y = 0$ as $a$ is not
    a zero divisor.
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
    An ideal $I \subsetneq R$ is called
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{prime} if $a \cdot b \in I$ implies $a \in I$ or $b \in I$ for all $a,b \in R$.
        \item \textbf{maximal} if $I$ and $R$ are the only ideals containing $I$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    In $R = \ZZ$, the ideals are of the form $n\ZZ$. $n\ZZ$ is prime $\iff$ $n$ is prime or $n = 0$.
\end{ex}
\begin{proof}
    (A Pranav Exlusive). We start with the forward direction. We proceed by contrapositive.
    Assume that $n \neq 0$ and that $n$ is not prime. Then, $n$ is composite (we exclude $n = 1$ as
    we must have a properly contained ideal by definition). Thus, we have that $n = ab$ for some $1 < a,b < n$.
    Note that we have $ab = n \in n\ZZ$, but we have that both $a$ and $b$ are less than $n$, and thus there is no $z \in \ZZ$
    such that $nz = a$ or $nz = b$. This means that $n\ZZ$ is not prime, as we have found $a,b$ such that
    $ab \in n\ZZ$ but neither $a$ nor $b$ are in $n\ZZ$. \\
    Now, the reverse direction. First, we show the condition for $n$ prime. Assume that we have $a,b \in \ZZ$ such that $ab \in n\ZZ$.
    This means that we have $ab = nq$ for some $q \in \ZZ$. In particular, this means that $n$ divides
    the product $ab$. However, we note that as $n$ is prime, we have that $n$ must divide $a$
    or $b$ by Euclid's lemma. Thus, we have that either $a = nr$ or $b = nr$ (or both), which implies
    that $a \in n\ZZ$ or $b \in n\ZZ$. Next, for $n = 0$. Well, if $ab \in 0\ZZ$, then $ab = 0$. This in $\ZZ$ implies
    that either $a$ or $b$  is $0$ and is also in $n\ZZ$. This completes the reverse direction.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}\label{thm:ideals}
    Let $R$ be a ring.
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item $R$ is a domain $\iff \{0\}$ is prime.
        \item $R / I$ is a domain $\iff I \subset R$ is a prime ideal.
        \item Let $\varphi: R \rightarrow S$ be a morphism, $S$ a domain. Then
        $\ker(\varphi)$ is prime. The converse is true if $\varphi$ is surjective.
        \item $R$ is a field $\iff \{0\}$ is maximal.
        \item $R / I$ is a field $\iff I \subset R$ is a maximal ideal.
        \item Every field is a domain.
        \item Every maximal ideal is prime.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We first claim that iii) implies ii) which in turn implies i). First, for iii) implies
    ii), we note that letting $S$ be $R / I$ (which means $\varphi$ is the projection
    map $p$ (which is definitely surjective)) gives us ii). (We have that $\ker(p) = I$).\\
    ii) implies i) simply by letting $I$ be the zero ideal. \\
    Now, we prove statement iii). \\
    Let $a, b \in R$ such that $a \cdot b \in \ker(\varphi)$. Then $0 = \varphi(a \cdot b) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)$.
    Since we have that $S$ is a domain, then we have no zero divisors, meaning that either
    $\varphi(a) = 0$ or $\varphi(b) = 0$. This in turn implies that either $a \in \ker(\varphi)$ or $b \in \ker(\varphi)$,
    so we have show that $\ker(\varphi)$ is a prime ideal. Now, the converse assuming surjectivity.
    We want to show that $S$ has no zero divisors. Well, fix $A,B \in S$ such that $A \cdot B = 0$.
    Since $\varphi$ is surjective, we have $a, b \in R$ such that $\varphi(a) = A$ and $\varphi(b) = B$.
    Then, we have $0 = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = \varphi(ab)$, meaning that $ab$ is in $\ker(\varphi)$.
    Because we assume that $\ker(\varphi)$ is prime, this in turn implies that either
    $a$ or $b$ is in $\ker(\varphi)$ meaning that either $\varphi(a) = 0$ or $\varphi(b) = 0$.
    This means that either $A$ or $B$ is 0, and thus $S$ is a domain, as desired. \\
    Next, note that v) implies iv). This comes from letting $I$ be the zero ideal. \\
    The proof of v) comes from the bijection
    $$
    \{\textrm{ideals in $R$ containing $I$}\} \leftrightarrow \{\textrm{ideals in $R/I$}\}
    $$
    This is a homework problem. \\
    Now, we show vi). Assume that $F$ is a field. Pick $a,b \in F$ such that $a \cdot b = 0$
    with $a \neq 0$. We will show that $b$ must be 0, thereby showing that $F$ is a domain.
    Well, since $a \neq 0$, and $F \backslash \{0\}$ is a group, we have that $a^{-1}$ exists.
    Thus, we have that $ab = 0$ implies that $a^{-1}ab = 0$ and thus $b = 0$, as desired. \\
    vii) follows from the facts vi), v) and ii). We have that
    \begin{center}
        $I$ is a maximal ideal $\overset{\textrm{v}}{\iff}$ $R/I$ is a field $\overset{\textrm{vi}}{\Rightarrow}$ $R / I$ is a domain
        $\overset{\textrm{ii}}{\iff}$ I is prime.
    \end{center}
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    Let $R$ b a domain. The canonical morphism $\ZZ \rightarrow R$ of Fact \ref{fact:!morph} has
    a prime ideal as its kernel. By Thm \ref{thm:ideals}, this is of the form

\begin{unnumlemma}
\textbf{(Zorn's Lemma)} (from Artin). An \textbf{inductive} (every totally ordered
subset has an upper bound) partially ordered set $S$ has at least one maximal element.
\end{unnumlemma}
\begin{thm}
    Let $R$ be a ring. Every proper ideal is contained in a max ideal.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $I \subset R$ be a proper ideal. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the set of all proper
    ideals of $R$ that contain $I$, with partial order given by inclusion. \\
    Let $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{M}$ be a totally ordered subset.
    \begin{claim}
        $J_0 = \left(\bigcup\limits_{J \in \mathcal{C}}{J}\right) \in \mathcal{M}$
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof} (of claim). We want to show that $J_0$ is a proper ideal containing
        $I$. First, we show it is an ideal by showing closure of the subgroup and the
        ideal multiplicative closure. Let $f_1, f_2 \in J_0$ and $a \in R$. Now, this means there
        is $J_1, J_2 \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $f_1 \in J_1$ and $f_2 \in J_2$. However,
        since $\mathcal{C}$ is totally ordered, we have that the larger of $J_1$ and $J_2$
        contains both $f_1$ and $f_2$, meaning that we have the existence of $J \in \mathcal{C}$
        such that $f_1,f_2 \in J$. Since $J$ is an ideal, we have that $f_1 + f_2 \in J$ and that
        $a \cdot f_1 \in J$. This thus implies that since $J \in \mathcal{C}$, we have that
        $a \cdot f_1$ and $f_1 + f_2$ are both in $J_0$. Thus $J_0$ is an ideal. Since $I \in \mathcal{C}$,
        we also have that $I \subset J_0$. Finally, $J_0$ is not $R$, because otherwise $1 \in J_0$,
        which would mean that $1 \in J$ for some $J \in \mathcal{C}$. This would then imply that
        that $J = R$, which is not possible as $J$ itself is a proper ideal. Thus, we have that $J_0 \in \mathcal{M}$.
    \end{proof}
    Thus, for every totally ordered subset of $\mathcal{M}$, we have the existence of an
    upper bound (namely $J_0$). This gives us, by Zorn's Lemma, that $\mathcal{M}$ has
    a maximal element. This maximal element is exactly what we wished to show existed.
\end{proof}

    Two ideals $I,J \subset R$ are \textbf{coprime} if $I + J = R$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
    \textbf{(Chinese Remainder Theorem)} Let $R$ be a ring, $I_1, \dots I_n \subset R$
    be pairwise coprime ideals. Then the natural morphism
    $$
    p: R \rightarrow R / I_1 \times R / I_2 \times \dots \times R / I_n
    $$
    factors through the quotient $R / (I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \dots \cap I_n)$ and induces
    an isomorphism of rings
    $$
    \overline{p}: R / (I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \dots \cap I_n) \rightarrow R / I_1 \times R / I_2 \times \dots \times R / I_n
    $$
    Moreover, $I_1 \cdot I_2 \cdots I_n = I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \dots I_n$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    As $p$ is the natural morphism to a product of rings, we let $p = p_1 \times p_2 \dots \times p_n$,
    where each $p_i$ is the projection morphism from $R$ to $R / I_i$. Now, we can say that
    $\ker(p) = \{r \in R \mid 0 = p_1(r), 0 = p_2(r), \dots 0 = p_n(r) \}$. Well, since each $p_i$ by definition has
    kernel exactly $I_i$, this is the same as saying that
    $\ker(p) = \{r \in R \mid r \in I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \dots \cap I_n \}$. \\
    By the homomorphism theorem (\ref{thm:homomorphism}), we have that $p$ factors through
    $R / I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \dots I_n$ and also induces an injective ring morphism
    $\overline{p}: R/ I_1 \cap \dots \cap I_n \rightarrow R/I_1 \times \dots R/I_n$.
    \begin{claim}
        $\overline{p}$ is also surjective, and hence a isomorphism.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof} (of claim)
        We note that since each of the ideals are coprime, we have that $I_1 + I_k = R$.
        Now, we also note that $R \cdot R = R$. Thus, we can express
        $$
        R = (I_1  + I_2) \cdot (I_1 + I_3) \cdots (I_1 + I_n)
        $$
        expanding the product, we note that by the earlier remark that any term
        containing an $I_1$ (which is almost all of them) will be contained in
        $I_1$. The only term that is outside arises from selecting the second term
        in every single term of the product, so we can write that the above expression
        is
        $$
        \subset I_1 + (I_2 \cdot I_3 \cdots I_n)
        $$
        Now, since $R \subset I_1 + (I_2 \cdot I_3 \cdots I_n)$, we can take
        $v_1 \in I_1$ and $u_1 \in I_2 \cdots I_n$ such that $u_1 + v_1 = 1$.
        Now, since $u_1 \in I_2 \cdots I_n$, $u_1 \in I_j$ for $j \neq 1$. Thus,
        we can say that $u_1$ maps to $0_{R/I_j}$ under the projection map, as it is
        in the kernel. \\
        Similarly, since $u_1 = 1 - v_1$, with $v_1 \in I_1$, we have that $u_1 \in 1 + I$,
        meaning that $u_1$ maps to $1_{R/I_1}$ under the projection map. \\
        So, we have (abusing notation) that $u_1 = 1$ in $R/I_1$ and $u_1 = 0$ in $R/I_j$ for $j \neq 1$
        (really, as we showed above, it belongs to the associated cosets). \\
        Now, we can repeat this construction with any $I_i$ instead of $I_1$.
        Thus, we get for each such construction a $v_i \in I_i$ and $u_i \in I_1 \cdot I_2 \cdots \widehat{I_i} \cdots I_n$
        With this construction, we now have the existence of the $u_i$ that belong
        to the $1$ coset in exactly $R/I_i$ and the $0$ coset in all remaining $R/I_j$.
        With this, we can prove surjectivity.
        Fix any $(x_1, \dots x_n) \in R/I_1 \times \dots R/I_n$. We have that there exists
        an associated $r_1, \dots r_n \in R$ such that $p_1(r_1) = x_1, \dots p_n(r_n) = x_n$.
        Now, if we consider the element $r \in R$ that equals $u_1r_1 + u_2r_2 \dots u_nr_n$,
        note that $p(r) = (p_1(r), p_2(r) \dots p_n(r))$. However, since the $u_i$ map to $1$ under
        $p_i$ and to $0$ otherwise, this maps precisely to $(x_1, \dots x_n)$. Thus, we have
 that $p(r)$ maps to the desired element in the product, meaning that the
        associated coset will map to the desired element under $\overline{p}$. This proves
        surjectivity.
    \end{proof}
    Thus, we have that $\overline{p}$ is an isomorphism. Now, we show the second part of
    part of the statement. \\
    Well, we know by definition that $I_1 \cdot I_2 \cdots I_n \subset I_1 \cap \dots \cap I_n$. So,
    we simply need to show the other containment, which we do by induction on $n$. \\
    $n = 1$: $I_1 \subset I_1$. \\
    $n = 2$: Take $u_1 \in I_1$ and $u_2 \in I_2$ such that $1 = u_1 + u_2$ (this exists as $I_1 + I_2 = R$.)
    Now, for any $u \in I_1 \cap I_2$, we have
    $$
    u = u \cdot 1 = u \cdot (u_1 + u_2) = u \cdot u_1 + u \cdot u_2
    $$
    Since $u \in I_1$ and $u \in I_2$, we have $u \cdot u_1 \in I_2 \cdot I_1$ and
    $u \cdot u_2 \in I_1 \cdot I_2$. Thus, we have the sum in $I_1 \cdot I_2$. This gives us
    $I_1 \cap I_2 \in I_1 \cdot I_2$. \\
    Now, for general $n$. By the inductive hypothesis, we have that
    $I_1 \cap I_2 \dots I_n \subset (I_1 \cdots I_{n-1}) \cap I_n$. From the claim above,
    we know that $R = (I_1 \cdot I_{n-1}) + I_n$. This implies thus that the ideals
    $(I_1 \cdots I_{n-1})$ and $I_n$ are coprime. Thus, applying the $n = 2$ case on these
    2 ideals, we have that $(I_1 \cdots I_{n-1}) \cap I_n \subset (I_1 \cdots I_{n-1}) \cdot I_n$,
    thereby proving the desired result. 
\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
        \item Any field is a domain.
        \item Any subring of a domain is a domain.
        \item Any subring of a field is a domain.
    \end{itemize}

Is the opposite true?
\begin{thm}
Let $R$ be a domain.

1) There exists a pair $(i,K)$ with $K$ a field, $i:R\rightarrow K$ an injective morphism such that if $(j,L)$ is another such pair, there exists a morphism $l:K\rightarrow L$ such that $j=l\circ i,$ which is to say that the following diagram commutes.

\begin{tikzcd}[,every arrow/.append style={maps to}
,every label/.append style={font=\normalsize},column sep=1.5em]
 & R \arrow{dr}{j}\arrow{dl}{i} \\
K \arrow{rr}{l} && L
\end{tikzcd}

2) If $(i',K')$ is another pair as in 1) there exists a unique isomorphism $\phi:K\rightarrow K'$ such that 

\begin{tikzcd}[,every arrow/.append style={maps to}
,every label/.append style={font=\normalsize},column sep=1.5em]
 & R \arrow{dr}{i'}\arrow{dl}{i} \\
K \arrow{rr}{\phi} && K'
\end{tikzcd} commutes.

\end{thm}

\rmk.

\begin{itemize}
	\item $(i,K)$ is an example of a ``universal object"
	\item $(j,L)$ is called a test object
	\item $K$ is produced from $R,$ just like the rationals are produced from the integers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proof}

2) Given two universal objects $(i,K),(i',K'),$ apply 1) with $(i,K)$ as the universal object, and $(i',K')$ as a test object to get $l:K\rightarrow K'$. Do it the other way to get $l':K'\longrightarrow K.$

\begin{claim}

$l\circ l'=\text{id}_{K'},l'\circ l=\text{id}_K$

\begin{proof}

Note that both $l'\circ l$ and $\text{id}_k$ make the diagrams

\begin{tikzcd}[,every arrow/.append style={maps to}
,every label/.append style={font=\normalsize},column sep=1.5em]
 & R \arrow{dr}{i}\arrow{dl}{i} \\
K \arrow{rr}{l'\circ l} && L
\end{tikzcd}

\begin{tikzcd}[,every arrow/.append style={maps to}
,every label/.append style={font=\normalsize},column sep=1.5em]
 & R \arrow{dr}{i}\arrow{dl}{i} \\
K \arrow{rr}{\text{id}_K} && L
\end{tikzcd} commute.

When $(i,k)$ is both a universal object and a test object, we get $l\circ l=\text{id}_K.$ \end{proof}
\end{claim}


1) Consider the set $P=R\times R\setminus\{0\}$. Introduce the relation $(n,d)\sim (n',d')\iff nd'=n'd$.

\begin{claim}

$\sim$ is an equivalence relation. 

\begin{proof} 

Reflexive: $(n,d)\sim(n,d)\iff nd=nd.$

Symmetric $(n,d)\sim(n',d')\iff nd'=n'd\iff n'd=nd'\iff (n',d')\sim (n,d).$

Transitive: Assume $(n_1,d_1)\sim(n_2,d_2)\sim(n_3,d_3)$. We want $(n_1,d_1)\sim(n_3,d_3).$
We have $n_1d_2=n_2d_1,n_2d_3=n_3d_2$ and want $n_1d_3=n_3d_1.$
We see that $n_1d_3 n_2d_2=n_1d_3n_2d_3=n_2d_1n_3d_2=n_3d_1n_2d_2.$
Since $R$ is a domain, $n_2d_2$ is not a zero-divisor. If $n_2d_2\ne 0$, then by Fact 6, Jan 6, we get $n_1d_3=n_3d_1$. If $n_2d_2=0$, then ($d_2\ne 0$ and not a 0-divisor) $n_2=0$. For the same reason, $n_1=n_3=0.$ Again, $n_1d_3=n_3d_1$. Either way, we are done.
\end{proof}
\end{claim}

Put $K=P/\sim.$ Write $[n,d]$ for the image of $(n,d)\in P$ in $K$. Define

$$[n,d]\cdot[n',d']=[nn',dd']$$

$$[n,d]+[n',d']=[nd'+n'd,dd']$$

$$0=[0,1],1=[1,1]$$

$$i:R\rightarrow K, i(r)=[r,1].$$

We leave as homework the verifications that $+,\cdot$ are well defined, that $K$ is a field, and that $i$ is a morphism. Injectivity is obvious. Given $(j,L)$, define $l:K\longrightarrow L$ by 

$$l([n,d])=l(i(n))\cdot l(i(d)^{-1})=j(n)j(d)^{-1}.$$

Homework: $l$ is well defined and a ring morphism.

\end{proof}

\begin{defn}

A pair $(i,K)$ is called a (the) field of fractions (fraction field) of $R$.

\end{defn}

\begin{defn}

1) Let $R$ be a ring. A polynomial in $T$ over $R$ is a formal expression $a_nT^n+a_{n-1}T^{n-1}+\ldots+a_0,a_i\in R.$

2) Given $P(T)=a_nT^n+\ldots+a_0,Q(T)=b_nT^n+\ldots+b_0$ define

$$(P+Q)(T)=(a_n+b_n)T^n+\ldots+(a_0+b_0)$$

$$(P\cdot Q)(T)=(c_mT^m+c_{m-1}T^{m-1}+\ldots+c_0$$ where 

$$c_k=\sum_{i+j=k}a_i\cdot b_j.$$

3) Given $r\in R$ we have the constant polynomial
$r:(a_nT^n+\ldots+a_0,a_0=r,a_i=0\text{ for } i>0).$ In particular, we have $0,1$ as constant polynomials.

4) Let $R[T]$ be the set of al polynomial in $T$ over $R$. 

\begin{fact} $(R[T],+,\cdot,0,1)$ is a ring. Moreover $R\rightarrow R[T]$, $r\rightarrow$ constant polynomial $r$ is an injective morphism. The proof is left as an exercise to the reader.
\end{fact}

2) deg$(P\cdot Q)\leq$ deg$(P)+$deg$(Q)$ with equality if the leading coefficient of $P$ (or $Q$) is not a 0 divisor.
3) In particular, if $R$ is a domain, so is $R[T].$ The proof is left as an exercise to the reader.

\begin{rmk}
Any $P \in R[T]$ gives a function $R \rightarrow R$ by $r \mapsto P(r) = a_nr^n + ... + a_0$.  However, $P$ is not necessarily determined by this function.  For example, let $R = \ZZ / p\ZZ$ where $p$ is a prime and $P(T) = T^p - T$.  Since $x^p = x$ for all $x \in R$, $P$ and $0$ give the same function.  However, $P \neq 0$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{ex}

\item $P = T^2 + 3T - 2$, $Q = -T^2 + 3T - 7$ gives $P+Q = 6T - 9$ ($\text{deg}(P+Q) < \max(\text{deg}(P),\text{deg}(Q))$)

\item $R = \ZZ/4\ZZ$, $P = 2T^2+1$, $Q = 2T^3+3T$ gives $PQ = 3T$ ($\text{deg}(PQ) < \text{deg}(P)+\text{deg}(Q)$)

\end{ex}

\begin{fact}
Let $\phi : R \rightarrow S$ be a morphism and let $s \in S$.  There exists a unique morphism $\phi_s : R[T] \rightarrow S$ such that $\phi_s(r) = \phi(r)$ for all $r \in R$ and $\phi_s(T) = s$.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
If $\phi_s$ is any such morphism then $\phi_s(a_nT^n + ... + a_0)$ must equal $\phi(a_n)s^n + ... + \phi(a_0)$.  This proves uniqueness and existence (upon checking that this is a morphism).
\end{proof}

\begin{ex} \hspace{0.5cm}

\begin{itemize}

\item If $\phi = id : R \rightarrow R$ then we get evaluation morphism $R[T] \rightarrow R$ given by $P \mapsto P(s)$.

\item Let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal and let $\phi : R \rightarrow R/I \xhookrightarrow{} R/I[T]$ and let $s = T$.  We get ``reduction mod $I$" morphism $R[T]\rightarrow R/I[T]$.

$a \in R$ is \textbf{nilpotent} if $a^n = 0$ for some $n \in \NN$
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}
Let $P = a_nT^n + ... + a_0 \in R[T]$.  We have $P \in R[T]^\times$ iff $a_0 \in R^\times$ and $a_1,...,a_n$ are nilpotent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} \hspace{0.5cm}

Assume that $R$ is a domain.  We have that $P$ is a unit iff there exists $Q \in R[T]$ such that $PQ = 1$.  By 1-11 Fact 6, $0 = deg(1) = deg(PQ) = deg(P) + deg(Q)$ ($R$ is a domain so the leading coefficient of $P$ (alternatively $Q$) is not a zero divisor).  Thus $deg(P),deg(Q) = 0$.  Thus $a_1,...,a_n = 0$ are nilpotent and $a_0 \in R^\times$.

Let $R$ be a general ring.  Let $\mathcal{P} \subseteq R$ be a prime ideal.  Since $P$ is a unit in $R[T]$, the image of $P$ in $R / \mathcal{P}[T]$ is a unit.  Since $R/\mathcal{P}$ is a domain by 1-6 thm. 8, by the above argument $a_1,...,a_n = 0_{R/\mathcal{P}}$ and thus $a_1,...,a_n \in \mathcal{P}$.  Since this holds for all $\mathcal{P}$, by HW we have that $a_1,...,a_n$ are nilpotent.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $P \in R[T]$ and $r \in R$.  We have $P(r) = 0$ iff $(T-r) \mid P$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

The backward direction is clear.  Apply fact 1 with $S = R[T]$, $\phi : R \xhookrightarrow{} R[T]$, $s = T+r$ to get a morphism $R[T] \rightarrow R[T]$.  This is an isomorphism with inverse given by the same construction with $s = T-r$.  Under this isomorphism, $P \mapsto Q$ with $Q(0) = 0$.  Thus $Q(T) = b_nT^n + ... + b_1T$ so $T \mid Q$.  Taking the preimage under the above isomorphism, we have $(T-r) \mid P$.

Gitlin's thoughts:  The constructed isomorphism can be thought of as the map $R[T] \rightarrow R[T]$ which ``replaces every $T$ with $T+r$."  Thus $Q(x) = P(x+r)$ for all $x \in R$.  In particular, $Q(0) = P(r)$ which is $0$.  The inverse map is the map $R[T] \rightarrow R[T]$ which ``replaces every $T$ with $T-r$."  In particular, the preimage of $Q(T) = b_nT^n + ... + b_1T$ is $b_n(T-r)^n + ... + b_1(T-r)$.

\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $P,D \in R[T]$.  Assume that $D \neq 0$ and that the leading coefficient of $D$ is a unit.  There exist unique $Q,Z \in R[T]$ with $deg(Z) < deg(D)$ such that $P = QD+Z$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}\hspace{0.5cm}

Choose $Q$ so that $deg(Z)$ is minimal where $Z = P-QD$.  We claim $deg(Z) < deg(D)$.  Suppose not.  Let $D = d_nT^n + ... + d_0$ and $Z = z_mT^m + ... + z_0$ with $m \geq n$.  Note that $P-(Q+z_md_n^{-1}T^{m-n})D = Z - (z_md_n^{-1}T^{m-n})D$ has degree less than $deg(Z)$, contradicting the minimality of $Z$.  This shows existence.

Gitlin's thoughts:  The set of ``candidates" is the set of elements of $R[T]$ that have the form $P-*D$ where $*$ varies over $R[T]$.  Clearly $P-(Q+z_md_n^{-1}T^{m-n})D$ is a candidate.  Furthermore, the leading term $z_mT^m$ of $Z$ cancels with the leading term $z_md_n^{-1}T^{m-n} \cdot d_nT^n = z_mT^m$ of $(z_md_n^{-1}T^{m-n})D$ in the subtraction $Z - (z_md_n^{-1}T^{m-n})D$ so the degree of $Z$ is at least one more than the degree of $Z - (z_md_n^{-1}T^{m-n})D$.

Let $Q',Z'$ be another such pair.  We have $QD+Z = P = Q'D+Z'$ so $(Q-Q')D = Z'-Z$.  Thus (1-11 fact 6) $deg(D) > \max(deg(Z'),deg(Z)) \geq deg(Z'-Z) = deg((Q-Q')D) = deg(Q-Q') + deg(D)$ (the leading coefficient of $D$ is a unit and thus not a divisor of zero).  This means $deg(Q-Q') = - \infty$ so $Q-Q' = 0$ so $Q= Q'$.  Thus $Z = P-QD = P-Q'D = Z'$.  This shows uniqueness.

Gitlin's thoughts:  My uniqueness proof likely differs from the one given in class.  Sorry Tasho.  I couldn't follow your inequalities.
